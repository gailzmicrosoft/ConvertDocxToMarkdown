# Convert .docx files into markdown .md files

**Python Code**: `ConvertDocxToMD.py.` 

The Python Program Converts Word .docx files into Markdown .md files. It can process transcripts generated by Microsoft Teams and then removes the image links inside the transcripts. The immediate application is to use these cleaned up markdown files as input to AI applications such as Open AI Studio / APIs. 

## File Directories 

Put all your .docx files in one directory. The program will ask for below paths:

1. Enter the input directory path for .docx files: `C:\data\docx_files_dir`
2. Enter the output directory path for RAW .md files: `C:\data\md_raw_files_dir`
3. Enter the output directory path for CLEAN .md files: `C:\data\md_clean_files_dir`

The final output .md files will be stored in the path defined in 3 above.
